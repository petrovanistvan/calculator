## Code structure

This calculator is implemented using the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in JavaScript. The Calculator class defines the main functionality of the calculator, including arithmetic operations and memory. 

The calculator's interface is created using HTML and CSS. The calculator's buttons and display elements are accessed using JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) API. The calculator's functionality is then bound to these elements using event listeners.

The calculator's code is structured as follows:

* The `Calculator` class that defines the calculator's functionality.
* The `numberButtons`, `operationButtons`, and other variables that store references to the calculator's buttons.
* Event listeners that bind the calculator's functionality to the buttons.

## How to run

To use this calculator, simply copy the code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser. The HTML file should reference the `calculator.css` file for styling and the `calculator.js` file for functionality. You can also use this code in any web development project by copying the relevant parts.
